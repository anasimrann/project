        <p>Hello, my name is Anas Bin Imran and I am a computer science student in my final semester at FAST University,
            which is considered to be the number one computer science university in Pakistan. However, my journey
            towards computer science actually began in ninth grade, where I discovered my passion for this field and
            secured an impressive 88% in my computer science course.

            Encouraged by my success in ninth grade, I continued to maintain my performance in computer science
            throughout my high school years, eventually getting admission into one of the top colleges in my city, Malir
            Degree Cantt College, to pursue a degree in engineering.

            However, after some time, I realized that my true interest lay in computer science, and I made the difficult
            decision to switch my focus and prepare for the test to get admission into FAST University. I was determined
            to succeed and worked hard to prepare for the test, eventually earning admission to the university.

            Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to explore different areas of computer science, from
            programming languages and software development to algorithms and data structures. I have also had the chance
            to work on a number of exciting projects, including a mobile application that I developed as part of my
            coursework and an internship I completed at a local software development company.

            Looking towards the future, I am excited to continue exploring the world of computer science and leveraging
            my skills and knowledge to tackle new challenges and create innovative solutions.</p>
